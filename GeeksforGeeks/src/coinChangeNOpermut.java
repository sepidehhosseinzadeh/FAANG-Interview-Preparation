/* Note: The tricky part is that question has asked for combinations not permutations
If only permutations were asked, we could have simply done dp[i]=dp[i-3]+dp[i-5]+dp[i-10],
as it does not care about the duplicate sets.

Now to avoid that,
1) first mark all values which can be made by moving 3.
eg. if n=8, all values that can be made using only 3 coins are multiple of 3.
Technically we write it as dp[i]=d[i]+dp[i-3].

2)Now moves using 3 are done, mark all moves by moving 5,
This gives us all combinations that can be made using only 3 and 5.
Technically we write it as dp[i]=dp[i]+dp[i-5].

3)Now moves using 3 and 5 are done, mark all moves by moving 10,
This gives us all combinations that can be made using 3, 5 and 10
(note that we would never come across duplicated in such a case)
Technically we write it as dp[i]=dp[i]+dp[i-10].
