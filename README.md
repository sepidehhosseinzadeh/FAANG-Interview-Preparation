## FAANG Interview Coding Preparation

### Coding until you solve the questions in 45 min
- Look at the solution if you can't solve it in 30 mins.
- Weekly leetcode/topcoder contests, track progress, note the questions with link for later review.

#### How to study:
- Use timer for 45 min, solve/study
- Use a work station separate from your rest station.
- After 45 min, you must rest and treat yourself.
- Look for meaning, patterns, differences and understand the code. Use print statements.
- Do/Code it yourself.
- Think out loud. Like you are teaching it.
- Take Note. 
- Sleep is important. 

#### Solving questions routine:
- Repeat the question in your own words
- Check assumptions and edge cases
- Use real examples
- Think out loud
- Brainstorm solutions and their time/space complexities
- Write a working code in 20-30 minutes
- Test edge cases (in your brain) line-by-line examples
- Practice makes perfect!

### Code and System Design:
#### Coding Interview Basics: 
- https://www.educative.io/courses/coderust-hacking-the-coding-interview
- Do not buy educative. Search the questions on leetcode.
- I was not able to do most of them so please look at the answer and upsolve. This will give you a great base to solve other similar questions.

### A week before the interview: 
- Company specific leetcode explore questions
- Company tagged leetcode discuss
- https://www.pramp.com/ everyday

* Follow this for 3-6 months.

### When are you ready? (measure of readiness)
- When you can solve 2 medium (1 hard) leetcode questions in 25 min.
- You should start by bruteforce solution, to have a clear understanding of the question. Then use a real example to brain storm solutions and time/space complexitties. 
- Edge case test before starting to code.
- Trust your modules/functions during coding.
- Timer starts when you start coding.
