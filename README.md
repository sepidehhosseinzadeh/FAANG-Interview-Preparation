## FAANG Interview Coding Preparation
### Step 0 - Coding until you solve the questions in 45 min
- Look at the solution if you can't solve it in 30 mins.
- Weekly leetcode/topcoder contests, track progress, note the questions with link for later review.

#### How to study:
- Use timer for 45 min, solve/study
- Use a work station separate from your rest station.
- After 45 min, you must rest and treat yourself.
- Look for meaning, patterns, differences and understand the code. Use print statements.
- Do/Code it yourself.
- Think out loud. Like you are teaching it.
- Take Note. 
- Sleep is important. 

#### Solving questions Routine:
- Repeat the question in your own words
- Check assumptions and edge cases
- Use real examples
- Think out loud
- Brainstorm solutions and their time/space complexities
- Write a working code in 20-30 minutes
- Test edge cases (in your brain) line-by-line examples
- Practice makes perfect!
